# @triplex-build/triplex

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 8bd86f8: Add a backend-neutral HTTP package that derives runtime schemas, OpenAPI, versioned REST CRUD, and
  atomic handlers from persisted Triplex configuration. Add exact-cut entity pagination and
  entity-state transaction preconditions to the public core service.
- fb53ec6: Publish the initial Triplex package family.

  Triplex provides an Effect-native bitemporal fact database, portable Datalog, a causal transaction
  journal, content-addressed typed configuration, graph constraints, derivations with provenance,
  SQLite and PostgreSQL storage, reusable backend conformance tests, and an agent-oriented CLI.

### Patch Changes

- 313542f: Fix large in-memory KV range collection and all-`0xff` key increments, and make the CLI's pre-1.0
  status explicit in help output. Preserve typed HTTP responses when synchronous request validation
  rejects malformed temporal parameters or cursors.
